Sketching is a two step process:
    Idea Generation (Generate and Sketch)
        - generate as many ideas and approaches to the problem then decide which to go for.
    Add Detail and Refinement
        - refine sketches and add details

    Prepare tools beforehand.
    Think of goals.
    Think of audience.
    Time Yourself.

Step 2:
    Draw a frame for your device.
    Start with basic/simple and redundant elements like headers and footers.
    Move onto more detailed interactions using basic shapes.
    Annotate your sketches and keep them safe.
    Keep going - find sketches you like and have potential then work on it.
    Share your sketches for feedbacks.

Step 3:
    Add titles to sketches to help determine relevant ones.
    Add anotations - explain purpose and clarify things.
    Use numbers to show flow.
    Use arrows to show transitions.
    Add gestures to show interaction with user.

Sketching User Flows
    - process/flow
    - micro interactions
    - navigation tree
