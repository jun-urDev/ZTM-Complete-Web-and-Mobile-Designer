Prototyping
    - the process of turning a static mockup into an interactive and dynamic mockup (better known as a prototype). Bringing a static mockup to life is without doubt one of the most — if not the most — exciting step in the design workflow. 

Triggers
    - determines what type of interaction with the hotspot will cause the Prototype to advance. This could be a mouse or touch interaction like tap, drag, click, and more. 

    On Click/On Tap
        - Triggers the action when the user Clicks (desktop) or Taps (mobile) on a hotspot in your prototype. You can add click or tap triggers to lots of different elements in a screen.
        - You can use them for navigation like opening links, using menus, or exploring websites. They can also be used when you need a user to click on buttons, fill in forms, or confirm and dismiss alerts.

    On Drag
        - Allows you to perform an action when you drag an element on the screen. This can be the entire frame or a single element like a slider.
        - You can use the On Drag in any direction: Left, Right, Up or Down. This is great for simple swipe gestures, or for more complex animations like a drag to refresh.
        - Drag allows you to move back and forward through the transition. This creates a continuum, instead of performing the action after a swipe gesture.

    While Hovering
        - Triggers the action when you hover over the hotspot. You can use this to replicate tooltips, on-screen prompts, or changes in state.
        - We will return the user to the original frame when they move the cursor off the hotspot. This makes it a great interaction when you don't want to take users away from the current screen.

    While Pressing
        - Triggers the action when you click and hold the mouse or trackpad on a desktop. Or, when you tap and hold on a mobile device.
        - You can use this trigger for navigating drop-down menus, or replicating long-press interactions like viewing a preview using 3D Touch on iOS.
        - When released, we will take the user back to the original Frame. This makes it great for Overlays that capture temporary interactions or state changes.

    Keyboard and Gamepad Shortcuts
        - The Keyboard / Gamepad trigger lets you replicate interactions with a keyboard shortcut. This applies to user inputs from keyboards, controllers, and gamepads.
        - A trigger can be a single key or button, or a combination of keys.
    
    Mouse Enter
        - This shows the Destination frame when the mouse enters the hotspot area. This could be a small area like a button, or an entire section of the screen.
        - You could use this to expose the options in a drop down menu as your mouse enters the field. The menu will stay open until the user performs another interaction like selecting an item or clicking out of the field.

    Mouse Leave
        - This shows the Destination frame when the cursor leaves the hotspot area.
        - You could use this for on-screen prompts, like an alert when you haven't completed a field or checked a box.

    Mouse Down (Touch Down)
        - This triggers the Destination frame when you first press the mouse or touch pad. For mobile devices, this is when the user's finger first touches the hotspot.
    
    Mouse Up (Touch Up)
        - This triggers the Destination frame when you release the mouse or touch pad. For mobile devices, this is once the user's finger no longer touches the Hotspot.
            - Apply the Mouse Down trigger to the menu header to open an Overlay.
            - Apply the Mouse Up interaction to the menu item in the Overlay.
            - When they release the mouse, we take the user to the relevant Frame.

    After Delay
        - The After Delay trigger allows you to trigger an action after the user has spent a certain amount of time on a given frame. You will need to set the duration of the delay in milliseconds (ms). You can only apply this to a top-level Frame, not a specific layer or object.

Animations 
    - can be used to create smooth transitions between pages and define the behavior for actions like expanding a menu, swiping between pages, or opening a gallery.

    Instant
        - The Instant transition will immediately display the Destination Frame, when the hotspot is interacted with (clicked, hovered over, or pressed).

    Dissolve
        - The Dissolve transition will fade in the Destination frame, on top of the original frame.
        Supports:
            - Duration
            - Easing

    Smart Animate
        - Smart Animate looks for matching layers that exist across multiple frames. For layers that match, we recognize what's changed and apply transitions to seamlessly move between them.
        Supports:
            - Duration
            - Easing

    Move In / Move Out
        - The Move transition will slide the Destination frame into or out of view, above the original frame.
        Supports:
            - Easing
            - Direction 
            - Duration 

    Push
        - The Push transition will push out the original frame, as the Destination frame is moved into view. This is the perfect transition for replicating a swiping gesture.
        Supports:
            - Easing
            - Direction 
            - Duration

    Slide In / Slide Out
        - The Slide will move the Destination frame into or out of view. Slide will slowly offset the frame as it dissolves, while the Move transition keeps the original frame stationary.
        Supports:
            - Easing
            - Direction 
            - Duration
