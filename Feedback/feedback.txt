Type of feedback that impacts your design
    1. Constructive - Help move design forward, uncover clues to open questions, identify blockers to idea's success and add momentum towards a direction.
    2. Destructive - Clouds the way your design moves forward, mislead and derail ideas from the problems that is needed to be solved by having irrelevant suggestions.

    The goal is to get your group to give you contructive feedback and what you need is:
        a. Be clear and provide context.
        b. Try preparing your invitees ahead of time with a quick intro before the meeting.
        c. Have clear goals.
        d. Let others know how far along your designs are.
        e. Bring up any big questions you want answers to.
        d. Invite only the people you need to.
        e. Put your attendees to work.
        f. Bookmark feedback that isn't relevant right now and come back to it as a group at a later time.

Giving useful feedback
    a. Start with a foundation of trust
        - Trust is a two-way street, and it must be established before a designer will receive your feedback with open arms.
    b. Frame your feedback with context
        - The most important thing about design feedback is that it must always remain framed by your project goals and metrics for success.
    c. Be clear and specific
        - Make sure you frame your feedback and describe precisely what it applies to (is it colour, layout, content design, usability, etc.).
    d. Describe problems, don’t offer solutions
        - Instead of providing the how, provide the why. You need to frame them as suggestions for one possible solution to explore and compare, rather than a prescriptive demand.
    e. Be prepared to explain your thinking
        - The design feedback process should be a discussion.
    f. Serve up a love sandwich
        - Explain what you like, move to concerns then follow up with a praise and end on a positive note.
    g. Stay objective
        - When providing feedback, it’s vital that you remove from the equation as much of your own aesthetic preference as possible.

Receiving desgin feedback
    a. Start early and ask often
        - Aim for frequent small updates and continuous feedback rather than large chunks of work with occasional feedback between.
    b. Stay open-minded and don’t take it personally
        - Lose your ego and stay open-minded to ideas no matter where they come from.
    c. Clarify and find the root of the cause
        - If your client doesn’t provide adequate justification for their requests, demand it.
    d. Present better solutions, and know how to justify them.
        - If your client requests a design solution that you believe is inferior to your ideas, show it to them anyway. 
    e. Take praise with grain of salt too!
        - If your client is too full of love and not enough critique, push them a bit harder to uncover the more subtle concerns they may have.
