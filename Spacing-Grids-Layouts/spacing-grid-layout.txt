Spacial System
    - set of rules for how you measure, size, and space your UI elements.

How do you start a spatial system?
    - Defining your base unit will allow you to create the scale of supported sizes in your spatial system.
    - 4pt, 5pt, 6pt, 8pt, 10pt are most commonly seen increment systems.

How do I apply a spatial system?
    - Applying the spatial scale to your UI elements can come in the form of padding, margin, height, and width definitions.

    Element first (strict element sizing)
        - the sizing of solid elements takes priority when matched to your predetermined spatial system.
        - This includes things like buttons and form inputs. These elements are more likely to have predictable content and are key to creating rhythm in the overall composition.

    Content first (strict internal padding)
        - When the content is less predictable and we care about its display, we will want to enforce strict internal padding and allow element sizes to be dictated by their content.
        - These element’s sizes may still fall into your spatial system’s rules but that is secondary to the spacing around the content. This is useful for tables with indeterminate user content.

Grid
    - helps you arrange your content into structured propositions.
    - structure comprising a series of lines dividing a page into columns (horizontal and vertical).

    Base Unit
        - defines what every single measurement will be a multiple of. (preferred is 8)

    Sizing 
        - All UI elements should be measured in increments of our base unit.

    Padding 
        - The spacing between all  of our elements should be based off of our base unit.

    Layout 
        Column 
            - vertical blocks that span from left to right.
        Gutter
            - white spaces between columns.
        Margin 
            - white space between the edge of column and edge of frame.

    Column grid
        - helps you organize content into evenly spaced vertical columns.
        - The space between columns is referred to as the gutter size. Applying your spatial system rules to the gutters will help drive home a consistent rhythm in your designs.
        - A common example is the 12 column grid because it allows you to divide the given area into half, thirds, fourths, sixths.

    Modular grid
        - takes columns and rows into account to organize content into a matrix structure.
        - Modular grids are ideal for a strict format layout like a book but can break down for a relative sized responsive web layout.

    Baseline grid
        - a baseline grid was used to set the leading from one line of text to the next. However, on the web, we place text by line-heights instead of the baseline.
        - setting the typography onto a consistent grid will be easier to organize, create vertical rhythm, and be aesthetically pleasing.

Composing a layout
    - Layouts are the culmination of defined spatial rules and the organization of content into one single composition.
    - There are three main concepts for crafting a layout that can scale gracefully.

    Adaptive
        - An adaptive layout is one that changes entirely based on the format it is presented in.

    Responsive
        - A responsive layout is fluid and can adapt to a changing format size.

    Strict
        - This layout will not flex with a changing format size.
        - Fixed layouts are often used to promote a specific interaction or informational layout that would be degraded at a smaller size.

Grid Guides
    - elements should sit on their own columns.
    - elements should never be left on the gutters.
    - outside column is not for padding.
