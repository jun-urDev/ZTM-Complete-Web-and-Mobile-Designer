Mobile Design Best Practices
    - the difference between a good app and a bad app is the quality of its user experience.

    Don't make users think.
        - if your app is too hard to use or understand, you risk having the user walk away from the product.

        1. Declutter
        2. Break task into smaller chunks
        3. Stick to patterns
        4. Minimize user inputs
        5. Consistency
        6. Give your user the illusion of control

        1. Think about standard navigation patterns
        2. Think about order
        3. Stay consistent
        4. Microinteractions and motion shouldn't be an afterthought
        5. Stick to basics
