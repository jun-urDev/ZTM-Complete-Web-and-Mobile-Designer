Elements of typography
    Fonts and Typefaces
        Typeface - is a design style which comprises a myriad of characters of varying sizes and weight.
        Font -  is a graphical representation of text character, a family of related fonts.

        Serif
            - comes off as traditional and elegant.
            - fonts that has serifs which are the curl on its edges.

            Categories:
                Old style (Goudy)
                    - Old-style serifs tend to have a rather drawn or calligraphic quality.
                Transitional (Times New Roman)
                    - Transitional fonts are often considered a midpoint between the old style and more modern styles.
                Modern (Didot)
                    - Tends to have thin serifs and plenty of contrast.
                Slab (Courier)
                    - No contrast, has thick serifs and continuous line width.

        Sans-Serif
            - "Without serif" translated from french, lacks serif qualities.

            Categories:
                Grotesque (Source Sans Pro)
                    - These typefaces often have letterforms that are very similar to serif typefaces, minus the serifs.
                Neo-Grotesque (Helvetica)
                    - They have a relatively plain appearance when compared to the grotesques.
                Humanist (Gills Sans)
                    - They’re more calligraphic than other sans-serifs, meaning they have a greater variation in line widths.
                Geometric (Futura)
                    - Geometric sans-serifs are more closely based on geometric shapes.

        Display (Lobster)
            - is a typeface that is intended for use at large sizes for headings, rather than for extended passages of body text.
            - Display typefaces will often have more eccentric and variable designs than the simple, relatively restrained typefaces generally used for body text.

        Monospace (Roboto Mono)
            - is a font whose letters and characters each occupy the same amount of horizontal space.
            - also called a fixed-pitch, fixed-width, or non-proportional font.
            - commonly used for technical fields.

    Contrast
        - helps to convey which ideas or message you want to emphasize to your readers.

    Consistency
        - is key to avoiding a confusing and messy interface.
        - it is a good practice to establish a consistent hierarchy of typefaces (one consistent font for headers, another for subheadings) and stick to it.

    White Space
        - Often referred to as ‘negative space,’ white space is the space around text or graphics.

    Alignment
        - is the process of unifying and composing text, graphics, and images to ensure there is equal space, size, and distances between each element.

    Color
        - it can make the text stand out and convey the tone of the message.
        - designers often test this by viewing the text in greyscale (without color) and making tweaks if the text is too dark or too light against the background color.

    Hierarchy 
        - creates a clear distinction between prominent pieces of copy that should be noticed and read first, and standard text copy.

Picking Typeface 
    Think of the mood or personality
        - think about values and words that describe the feeling of what you want to create.
        - Limit yourself to three to five traits, then you can start to get a sense of the direction your font needs to go in.

    Consider visual and tonal direction 
        - Visual is very much the font and how it looks, while tonal is the arrangement of words to form a message.

    Consider performance
        - It’s always worth making sure that your chosen font is web safe and can be rendered perfectly in a browser.

    Test rigorously
        - Always test your type in ways that are relevant to the project.
        - You don't know if a typeface will work until you've seen it at the right size and tested whether the spacing works.

    Pair up properly
        - start by defining what you want to achieve: harmony or contrast.
