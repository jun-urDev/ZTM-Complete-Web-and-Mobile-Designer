Color Theory
    - is the collection of rules and guidelines which designers use to communicate with users through appealing color schemes in visual interfaces.

Color 
    Primary (red, blue, yellow) 
    Secondary (mixes of primary colors)
    Tertiary (or intermediate – mixes of primary and secondary colors)

Color Properties
    Hue – How it appears (e.g., “is green”).
    Chroma – How pure it is: i.e., if it has shades (black added), tints (white added) or tones (grey added).
    Lighting – How pale or saturated it appears.

Color Schemes
    - In screen design, designers use the additive color model, where red, green and blue are the primary colors.
    
    Monochromatic 
        – Take one hue and create other elements from different shades and tints of it.

    Analogous 
        – Use three colors located beside one another on the color wheel (e.g., orange, yellow-orange and yellow to show sunlight). A variant is to mix white with these to form a “high-key” analogous color scheme (e.g., flames).

    Complementary 
        – Use “opposite color” pairs—e.g., blue/yellow—to maximize contrast.

    Split-Complementary (or Compound Harmony) 
        – Add colors from either side of your complementary color pair to soften contrast.

    Triadic 
        – Take three colors which are equally distant on the color wheel (i.e., 120° apart: e.g., red/blue/yellow). These colors may not be vibrant, but the scheme can be as it maintains harmony and high contrast. It’s easier to make visually appealing designs with this than with a complementary scheme.

    Tetradic 
        – Take four colors that are two sets of complementary pairs (e.g., orange/yellow/blue/violet) and choose one dominant color. This allows rich, interesting designs. However, watch the balance between warm and cool colors.

    Square 
        – A variant of tetradic; you find four colors evenly spaced on the color wheel (i.e., 90° apart). Unlike tetradic, square schemes can work well if you use all four colors evenly.

Important Ideas
    - color can help reinforce the personality of your brand.
    - think about what these colors mean to you.

Helpful Tips:
    - Color should be scalable and additive.
    - Always tint your grays and blacks.
    - Color contrast creates hierarchy and ensures accesibility. 

Contrast 
    - is the difference in luminance or color that makes an object (or its representation in an image or display) distinguishable.
