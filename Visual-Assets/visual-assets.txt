Logo Guidelines
    1. Space around the logo
        - There should be sufficient clear space around the logo to let it breathe and prevent it’s clarity and visual impact from being obstructed.
    2. Color palette  
        - A brand’s color palette is usually made up of four or five colors and either include or are complimentary with the colors of their logo.
        - The rule of thumb is to pick:
            a. One light color to use as the background
            b. One darker color for text
            c. One neutral shade that goes with everything
            d. One color that catches the eyes
    3. Typography and Font 
        - questions to help you set typography rules within your logo usage guidelines:
            a. What is your brand font?
                - This is the first aspect of your typography guideline you will need to determine.
            b. Why is this your font?
                - Tell the story of what makes this font the best representative for your brand.
            c. What is the font you use for other communications?
            d. Will you allow any shading or effects in the typography surrounding your brand.
    4. Logo size
        - minimum size is ideally in pixels for digital use and in inches or millimeters for print.
        - setting proportional values is as important as setting a minimum size.
    5. Description of the logo
        - the logo in essence, is the brand name, but not all logos need to include a name.
        - the description of your logo is a brief explanation of what your logo looks like and why.
    6. Logo colors
        - one of the key principles of logo design is that your logo should look good in black and white, in its simplest form with no effects.
