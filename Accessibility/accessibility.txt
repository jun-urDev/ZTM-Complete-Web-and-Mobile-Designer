Accessibility
    - the concept of whether a product or service can be used by everyoneâ€”however they encounter it.
    - is concerned with whether all users are able to access an equivalent user experience, however they encounter a product or service.
    - Accessibility is not a checklist. It should be ingrained in the way we design.

Accessibility Issues:
    These are common barriers:
        a. Visual (e.g., color blindness)
        b. Motor/mobility (e.g., wheelchair-user concerns)
        c. Auditory (hearing difficulties)
        d. Seizures (especially photosensitive epilepsy)
        e. Learning/cognitive (e.g., dyslexia)

    Ability barriers can also arise for any user:
        a. Incidental (e.g., sleep-deprivation)
        b. Environmental (e.g., using a mobile device underground)

Assistive Technologies

        Braille Terminals
            - is an electro-mechanical device for displaying characters, usually by means of round-tipped pins raised through holes in a flat surface.
        Screen Magnification Software 
            - is a software that interfaces with a computer's graphical output to present enlarged screen content.
        Alternate Input and Software Devices
            - are hardware or software solutions that allow users with a variety of impairments to access a computer in a different way.

Visual Patterns For Accessibility
    a. Color Contrast
    b. Labels
    c. Focus States
    d. Hover States
    e. Click Targets
    f. Target Areas
