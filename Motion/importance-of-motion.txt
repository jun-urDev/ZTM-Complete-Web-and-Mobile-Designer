The importance of motion for UX design
    Guidelines
        - They try to set a standard for motion for designers to use in the apps they design for Google’s Android platform — following four main principles, namely: 
            a. Responsive 
            b. Natural
            c. Aware
            d. Intentional
        - They coin a variety of terms, such as Material Response, Point of Origin, Delightful Details and more. These are essentially best practices respecting the aforementioned principles.
        - The main vision of Material Design is to honour rules of three-dimensional space, and giving objects and characters appropriate dimensionality through visualisation of volume and weight.

    Other Principles
        - Overdoing motion can cause frustration with users, unnecessarily (re)directing their attention, and their mental model can be challenged by wrongly applied spatial patterns, or inconsistent motion.

    Shortening Perceived Loading Times
        - Loading screens for example can be perceived to be quicker by the user if there are animations, whether or not funny or celebratory.

    It is important for UX designers to have understanding of motion design, develop a feeling for how and where to apply it based on core principles/guidelines, and especially when not to apply it.
